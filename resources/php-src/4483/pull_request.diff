-PCRE2 LICENCE
--------------
-
-PCRE2 is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
-and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.
-
-Release 10 of PCRE2 is distributed under the terms of the "BSD" licence, as
-specified below, with one exemption for certain binary redistributions. The
-documentation for PCRE2, supplied in the "doc" directory, is distributed under
-the same terms as the software itself. The data in the testdata directory is
-not copyrighted and is in the public domain.
-
-The basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also
-included in the distribution is a just-in-time compiler that can be used to
-optimize pattern matching. This is an optional feature that can be omitted when
-the library is built.
