+## ImportError due to failure in loading capstone while importing angr
+There's a known [issue](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/issues/445) in installing capstone_3.0.4 using pip in virtualenv/virtualenvwrapper environment. Several users have further reported to be affected by the same bug in native Python installation, too. (See the discussion in Github bug report).
+
+In virtual environment, if capstone Python files are installed in `/home/<username>/.virtualenvs/<virtualenv>/lib/python2.7/site-packages/capstone/*.py(c)`, capstone library file will be found in `/home/<username>/.virtualenvs/<virtualenv>/lib/python2.7/site-packages/home/<username>/.virtualenvs/<virtualenv>/lib/python2.7/site-packages/capstone/libcapstone.so`

+In native environment, if capstone Python files are installed in `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/capstone/*.py(c)`, capstone library file will be found in `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/capstone/libcapstone.so`
+
+Moving `libcapstone.so` to the same directory as that of Python files will fix the problem.
