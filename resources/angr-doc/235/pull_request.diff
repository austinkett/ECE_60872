-If you're unlucky and run into a broken build script with Clang, try using GCC.
+angr requires the `unicorn` library, which (as of this writing) `pip` must build from source on macOS, even though binary distributions ("wheels") exist on other platforms. Building `unicorn` from source requires Python 2, so will fail inside a virtualenv where `python` gets you Python 3. If you encounter errors with `pip install angr`, you may need to first install `unicorn` separately, pointing it to your Python 2:
+```bash
+UNICORN_QEMU_FLAGS="--python=/path/to/python2" pip install unicorn  # Python 2 is probably /usr/bin/python on your macOS system
+```
+Then retry `pip install angr`.
 
+If this still doesn't work and you run into a broken build script with Clang, try using GCC.
 ```bash
 brew install gcc
-env CC=/usr/local/bin/gcc-6 pip install angr
+CC=/usr/local/bin/gcc-8 UNICORN_QEMU_FLAGS="--python=/path/to/python2" pip install unicorn  # As of this writing, brew install gcc gives you gcc-8
+pip install angr
 ```
 
 After installing angr, you will need to fix some shared library paths for the angr native libraries.

 You can't do that. Python does not work that way.

 You have the `keystone` package installed, which conflicts with the `keystone-engine` package (an optional dependency of angr).
 Please uninstall `keystone`.
 If you would like to install `keystone-engine`, please do it with `pip install --no-binary keystone-engine keystone-engine`, as the current pip distribution is broken.
