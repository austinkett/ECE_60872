+Add options to quiet build configuration and build with ``-Werror``
+-------------------------------------------------------------------
+Added two new configuration options. During the ``build_src`` subcommand, as
+part of configuring NumPy, the files ``_numpyconfig.h`` and ``config.h`` are
+created by probing support for various runtime functions and routines.
+Previously, the very verbose compiler output during this stage clouded more
+important information. By default the output is silenced. Running ``runtests.py
+--debug-configure`` will add ``-v`` to the ``build_src`` subcommand, which
+will restore the previous behaviour.
+
+Adding ``CFLAGS=-Werror`` to turn warnings into errors would trigger errors
+during the configuration. Now ``runtests.py --warn-error`` will add
+``--warn-error`` to the ``build`` subcommand, which will percolate to the
+``build_ext`` and ``build_lib`` subcommands. This will add the compiler flag
+to those stages and turn compiler warnings into errors while actually building
+NumPy itself, avoiding the ``build_src`` subcommand compiler calls.
