+Each document indexed is versioned. When deleting a document, the `version` can
+be specified to make sure the relevant document we are trying to delete is
+actually being deleted and it has not changed in the meantime. Every write
+operation executed on a document, deletes included, causes its version to be
+incremented. The version number of a deleted document remains available for a
+short time after deletion to allow for control of concurrent operations. The
+length of time for which a deleted document's version remains available is
+determined by the `index.gc_deletes` index setting and defaults to 60 seconds.
